Team 5 "Temple Fall" Milestone2 Write Up

This is our original plan: 
- (de)bug free release version
- level/options menuing if needed
- User controls, documented economically
- Unpolished and tunable physics
- Collision detection and effects; platforming essentials
- Rising stairs/falling spikes core gameplay mechanic
- Camera and viewport UI
- Low effort, thoughtful graphics
- Concept art revisited and improved sketches
- Audio system testing
- Music and sound effect ideas
- Portability testing

Our progress:
Unfortunately, we did not get as much done as we had hoped due to scheduling conflicts and
other family events. In order to compensate for this delay, we will work harder next milestone.

- [X] Walking Animations                - raider now has custom png files and can turn around
- [X] Scrolling Background              - background loops with help of custom shaders
- [X] Spike Ceiling                     - better spiked ceilings w/ fixed bugs from last time
- [X] 'Realistic' Gravity(acceleration) - realistic gravity that accelerates player
