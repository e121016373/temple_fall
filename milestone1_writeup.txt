Team 5 "Temple Fall" Milestone1 Write Up

This is our original plan: 

executable with no features except debugging/testing
project folder with revision control
target platforms identified
gameplay mechanics outlined in terms of implementation
level/scenario/progression devices or lack thereof
rough UI sketches/UX ideas
concept art sketches

Our progress:
Suprisingly, we have accomplished more features than what we originally expected, and we have accomplished the following:

 - Spike Ceiliing: appears at the top of the screen and ends the game when the player touches it.
 - Movable Character: can move left and right.
 - Platform generation: platforms are spawned at a steady rate, and they are constantly rising up.
 - Physics: the player will fall when it is in the air.
 - Platform collision: when the player stands on a platform, it will stop falling and the platform will bring the player up.
 - Scoreboard: as long as the player stays alive, scoreboard will keep track of the score.
 - Sound and background: we updated the sound and music to suit the game better, we also updated the background to fit into the ancient tomb atmosphere.
